# 📚 Lessons

</div>

A collection of small, focused lessons exploring programming concepts, tools, and ideas across various languages and subjects.

Each folder contains one topic, with code, explanations, and output where helpful.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Sometimes the best way to understand something is to break it down and build a tiny, runnable example.  
This repo helps me (and maybe you) do just that — one topic at a time.
